## Activity Guidelines

### Product/Project Reveal & Progress Sharing
- The assigned member shares one product or up to three related products during their session.
- Before the session, they must specify which single product will be shared on the WhatsApp group for visibility.
- Examples of products include designs, projects, or any IT/CS-related work.
- The assigned member must provide a focus for the discussion, e.g., "How's this product's interface? Test for bugs. Any improvements?" This ensures targeted feedback.
- Other members will monitor, test, and review the product(s), preparing their comments and feedback for the following day's session.

### Feedback & Improvement Discussion
- Members discuss the assigned product shared during the previous session.
- Constructive feedback is provided, including suggestions for improvements, bug reports, and overall assessment.
- The discussion promotes collaborative problem-solving and continuous improvement.
